    <p>Hello I am Beck Sonniksen.<br>
      I am a <strong>chemistry</strong> major.<br>
      I am probably also a <strong>math</strong> major.<br>
      Theoretically I could also be a <strong>computer science</strong> major.

    <img src="IMG_5949.jpeg" width="1080px" alt="A photo of a double rainbow over a canyon"></img>
    <p>This picture was taken at Canyonlands National Park during my first drive to Salem in 2022. I am very proud of it.</p>
