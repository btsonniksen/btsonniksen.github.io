        <h1>Saving Money Machine, Inc.</h1>
        <h2>A 3-Step Plan</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: <span class="emphasis">Cut the Fat</span></h3>
        <p>Every week, every low-level employee are required to write a <span class="emphasis">500-word paper</span> on the value of their contributions
            <ul>
                <li>If they are not willing to do this, they are unmotivated — <span class="emphasis">fired</span>
                <li>If they do not submit at least 100 words over the word count, they are doing the bare minimum — <span class="emphasis">fired</span>
                <li>Submissions must incorporate the blockchain
            </ul>
            The merit of each submission will be decided via generative AI to avoid overhead <span class="money">($$$)</span>
        </p>

        <h3>Step 2: <span class="emphasis">Nominal Raises</span></h3>
        <p>At this point, some employees may be unmotivated due to unavoidable economic circumstances (not due to our actions). To retain our remaining workforce, all employees will receive a <span class="money">$</span>10.00 raise.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: <span class="emphasis">Save the Investors</span></h3>
        <p>Investors are <span class="emphasis">pulling funding</span> due to our "regressive" climate change policies. Here is the plan:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>We announce an <span class="emphasis">ambitious goal</span> to reduce our emissions. The estimated date is far in the future.</li>
            <li>We do not work towards this goal</li>
            <li>News articles are written about Money Machine's <span class="emphasis">ambitious, forward-thinking</span> goals.</li>
            <li>Investors give our money <span class="money">($$$)</span> back to us</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Here is how much money we will save:</p>

        <p>But how much money will we really save?</p>
